    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This authentic recipe was given to me by a visiting Argentinean professor
      while I was studying Spanish in college. They have become a staple food in
      my household as they are both simple to make, and delicious.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound yellow onions, chopped</li>
      <li>6 scallions, chopped</li>
      <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons dried oregano</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter, or as needed</li>
      <li>36 empanada pastry discs</li>
      <li>1 egg white, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Step 1</li>
      <p>
        Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions, scallions,
        and bell pepper. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are
        translucent, 10 to 15 minutes.
      </p>
      <li>Step 2</li>
      <p>
        Add ground beef, oregano, salt, cayenne pepper, and cumin to the onion
        mixture. Cook and stir beef until no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes.
        Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly, then cover and place in
        the refrigerator until meat is completely cooled, about 1 hour.
      </p>
      <li>Step 3</li>
      <p>
        Remove filling from the refrigerator and transfer into a colander to
        drain. Return filling to the Dutch oven.
      </p>
      <li>Step 4</li>
      <p>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Liberally grease a
        baking sheet with butter.
      </p>
      <li>Step 5</li>
      <p>
        Place about 2 tablespoons filling into the center of an empanada disc.
        Fold empanada in half into a crescent shape, press the edges of the
        dough together with a fork or your fingers to seal, and place onto the
        prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining empanadas and filling.
        Brush tops with egg white.
      </p>
      <li>Step 6</li>
      <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.</p>
    </ol>
