    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This quinoa dish is a delicious and higher protein alternative to Spanish
      rice. This is a nice side dish to a Mexican meal, or it can be used as a
      filling in burritos. I like my food on the less-salty side, so you may
      have to adjust the seasonings to your taste.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 cup uncooked quinoa</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 small green bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

      <li>Step 1</li>
      <p>
        Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir
        in the quinoa, onion, garlic, and green pepper. Cook and stir 5 to 10
        minutes until the onion is tender, and the quinoa has lightly toasted.
        Stir in the tomato sauce and water, then season with the chili powder,
        garlic powder, and cumin. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to
        medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, and the liquid
        is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Stir the quinoa occasionally as it cooks.
